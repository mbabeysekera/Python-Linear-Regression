# Python-Linear-Regression
Test prediction on Rain Fall vs Temperature and Month in Sri Lanka

This project was done to represent the behviour of the Linear regression learning algorithm with model parameters.

This python program was mainly developed for analising the rain fall in Sri Lanka within a whole year.
But this is not the best model because to predict somthing which is highly depend on lots of factors cannot be predicted by only using 
two or three factors. 

This is just for study purposes for those who are interested about Machine Learning.

Thank You !!!
